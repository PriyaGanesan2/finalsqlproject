# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
- My goal here in this project has been to apply the  skill acquired in the past few weeks and to solve the questions asked here to my best.
  Database was created my importing the CSV files,  understand the data thatâ€™s given, understand what is required to be solved and then clean and transform the data accordingly

## Process
### Part 1: Create database and load the table

#### CLONE GIT REPO TO LOCAL MACHINE.
--    CODE --> GET HTTS LINK AND COPY THE LINK
-- 	  GO TO THE FOLDER IN LOCAL MACHINE WHERE YOU WANT TO CLONE THIS FOLDER 
-- 	  git clone <HTTPS LINK FROM PROVIOUS STEP>
-- 	  https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository
####  DOWNLOAD THE CSV FILES AND CRAETE DB ECOMMERCE
--1. COPY THE HEADER COLOUM OF THE CSV
-- 	   2. CONVERT TO TEXT
-- 	   3. CREATE TEH SQL QUERY TO CRAETE TABLE
-- 	   4. KEEP ALL FIELDS AS VARCHAR
-- 	   5. CREATE TABLE
-- 	  6.REFRESH
-- 	  7. RUN TRUNCATE TABLE QUERY
-- 	  8. IMPORT/EXPORT CSV
-- 	  9. QUERIES FOR THIS DB AS BELOW.
--    10, https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/import-csv-file-into-posgresql-table/

--    3)create table 
```
select count(*) from all_sessions
```
```
Create table analytics(
 visitNumber	varchar,
visitId varchar,	
visitStartTime varchar,	
date1 varchar,
fullvisitorId varchar,	
userid varchar,	
channelGrouping	varchar,
socialEngagementType varchar,	
units_sold varchar,	
pageviews varchar,	
timeonsite varchar,
bounces	varchar,
revenue	varchar,
unit_price varchar)
```

```
TRUNCATE TABLE analytics 
 RESTART IDENTITY;
```
```
select * from analytics
```
```
select * from all_sessions
```

```
Create table products(
SKU	 varchar,
name varchar,	
orderedQuantity varchar,	
stockLevel varchar,	
restockingLeadTime varchar,		
sentimentScore varchar,	
sentimentMagnitude varchar)
```

```
TRUNCATE TABLE products
RESTART IDENTITY;
```

```
select * from products
```
```
Create table sales_by_sku(
productSKU	varchar,
otal_ordered varchar)
```
```
TRUNCATE TABLE sales_by_sku
 RESTART IDENTITY;
```
 
```
select * from sales_by_sku
```
```
Create table sales_report(
productSKU	varchar,
total_ordered	 varchar,
name1 varchar,
stockLevel varchar,
restockingLeadTime varchar,	
 sentimentScore varchar,	
sentimentMagnitude	varchar,
ratio varchar)
```
```
TRUNCATE TABLE sales_report
RESTART IDENTITY;
```
 
```
select * from sales_report
```

### Part 2: Create database and load the tables Understand what we are trying to solve
### Part 3: - Clean and transform data and apply QA process to validate data transformation
### Part 4:- Provide possible answers to the questions and apply QA process to validate
## Results
- The data in the ecommerce database helped me understand a part of the flow of this ecommerce website.
- This analysis further helped me in answering the questions required to complete this project

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
- The data that is provided here is enormus and a lot of time went into understanding them and then cleaning to complete the project.
- If i were to apprpach a problem like this again, I would be directly start with answering the questions first and see how these wpul lool at a high level and then start deep diving , cleaning and then iterating all over to refine the query
- 

## Future Goals

-1. Analyse the alalytics table a bit more in details and come up with 
      -compute the percentage of visitors to the site that actually makes a purchase
      -find each unique product viewed by each visitor
      -work on the all_sessions table and clean it up a bit more to display category and productname values
      -deep dive a bit more to understan the data in other tables like sales_report and sales_by_sku
      - validate the solution for the  5 questions a bit more
